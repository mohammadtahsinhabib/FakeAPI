# FakeAPI

FakeAPI is a simple, lightweight API for testing and prototyping front-end projects without a real backend. It provides fake product data and allows you to simulate adding products to a cart.

## Features

- Retrieve fake product data
- Add products to cart dynamically
- Responsive UI design
- Easy to integrate into any web project

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Browse products and add them to the cart to see dynamic updates.

## Usage

Call the function `handleAddToCart(title, price)` to add a product to the cart dynamically. For example:

```js
handleAddToCart("Product Name", "$10.00");
